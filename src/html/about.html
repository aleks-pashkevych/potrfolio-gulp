  <h1 class="about__headline">Hello, I am Alex, Web Developer.</h1>
  <p class="about__description">
    Hello. Thanks for your interest in my personality. I know that you are very
    busy and reading additional information is not always possible for you.
  </p>
  <p class="about__description">
    However, I’d like to introduce myself and share some of my knowledge and
    experience with you.
  </p>
  <p class="about__description">
    Even though my experience is not great in front-end development, I started
    solving various non-standard problems more than 15 years ago, when decided
    to use Linux Ubuntu as my main operating system, for various reasons. Later,
    when I began to feel confident, I decided to try something else and started
    to learn computer science. From the beginning, it was a hobby.
  </p>
  <p class="about__description">
    However, now I want to try myself with professional web development. I’m
    familiar with HTML5, CSS3, SCSS, javascript, git, gulp, Webpack, and React.
  </p>

  <p class="about__description">
    In the edition, this page was created in single-page mode (like it was done
    in react). During creation used HTML, SCSS, vanilla javascript, and build
    everything using gulp.
  </p>
  <p class="about__description">
    I’ll be really happy if you decide to give me a chance to work with you, any
    suitable way of finding me you can find in the 'Contacts' section. Thanks
    for your invitation.
